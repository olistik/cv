# Maurizio De Magnis - Resume

> I'm a full stack developer, mainly focused on the Web ecosystem.

Nowadays my toolchain is mainly centered around **Ruby** and **Javascript** but I'd like to dig into other cool technologies.

I seek beauty in what I do and I'm a huge fan of **#FreeSoftware #Design #DevOps #InfoSec**.

Some of the companies I developed for over the past decade are:

- [The Fool](https://thefool.it)
- [Prada](https://prada.com)
- [Mikamai](https://mikamai.com)
- [Cayenne](https://cayenne.it)
- [IFS Italy](http://www.ifsitaly.com)
- [Hiperpool](https://hiperpool.com)
- [Antonioli](https://www.antonioli.eu)
- [Buongiorno](http://buongiorno.com)
- [Glossom](https://www.glossom.com) (now Arthewall)

I did _frontend dev_, _backend dev_, _web design_, _system administration_ and _project management_.

I like agile practices, such as _Scrum_ and _Kanban_, whenever they represent a good option.

Since 2011 I mainly work remotely and I try to value face time as much as possible.
